# Overview

This is a data analysis site looking into Critical Role, season two, as an example of DnD podcasts. It looks into the player rolls and podcast transcripts to extract insights about how the two effect each other. It was a super instructive practice in analyzing textual data, processing data with pandas and displaying it with plotly express.

Podcast transcripts were collected by [MATHEUS DE ALBUQUERQUE](https://www.kaggle.com/matheusdalbuquerque) and posted on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/). Additional data on dice rolls was collected by the Critical Rol community and posted on [CritRoleStats.com](https://www.critrolestats.com/).

I wrote this software to see if there was a discernable link between the transcripts of a dnd episode and the average dice rolls of the players. I measured the average rolls, the instances of maximum and minumum rolls (natural 1s and natural 20s) and compared them to frequency of swear words and overall posivite/negative and subjective/objective each episode.
